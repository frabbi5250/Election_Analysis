Analyze election audit of congressional elections

I.) Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the project was on organizing and analyzing election audit of a congressional election. Election audits are reviews that are collected after polls in order to indicate whether or not the election was done accurately with proper procedures. The following information that were needed to be recorded were: the number of votes cast in the congressional election, the breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county, county with the largest number of votes, the breakdown of the number of votes and percentage of the total votes for each candidate, and the candidate that won the election and what their vote count along with their percentage of the total votes.

III.) Election-Audit Summary
Such modifications  can be provided within the script in order to find the number of votes, such as filters like demographics and geography. The script can be modified to determine the percentage of voters by county against each candidate, enabling us to see which candidate within which county or geographical area was the most popular.
